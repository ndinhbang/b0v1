# Hands-On Introduction to Unikernels

References: https://labs.iximiuz.com/tutorials/unikernels-intro-93976514

Virtual machines provide a level of **isolation** unattainable by any flavor of Linux container. Virtualization technologies are widely adopted in the industry as a response to stringent security requirements, particularly in environments that share hardware between multiple tenants and *must* guarantee **opaque boundaries** between those tenants. It shouldn't come as a surprise that cloud hyperscalers provide access to compute in various forms of virtual machines[1](https://labs.iximiuz.com/tutorials/unikernels-intro-93976514#user-content-fn-aws) rather than some abstraction on top of a shared OS kernel.

But reaping the security benefits of virtual machines typically requires compromising on performance aspects. Cold booting an entire operating system takes **significantly more time** than spawning an OS process, which hinders dynamic application scaling. Also with each VM's kernel making independent scheduling decisions on top of the same hardware resources (CPU, memory, network, GPUs, ...), running multiple general-purpose operating systems such as Linux side by side requires smart hypervisors in order to **distribute those resources** optimally[2](https://labs.iximiuz.com/tutorials/unikernels-intro-93976514#user-content-fn-dblsched).

You will often encounter the term "Micro VM" to describe a type of virtual machine that attempts to address the aforementioned limitations by **reducing their memory footprint** through restricted device support and guest[3](https://labs.iximiuz.com/tutorials/unikernels-intro-93976514#user-content-fn-guest) functionalities. While this approach demonstrates measurable improvements to boot times, the guest itself still carries the **overhead** of a full, general-purpose operating system.

Unikernels propose a solution to that exact problem.

Throughout this tutorial, you will learn what a unikernel is made of and even build one yourself. You will be guided throughout the steps required for running this unikernel on any Linux host, then package it as an OCI image that can be run by Docker.

## Requirements

*   Notions about virtualization: what is a virtual machine, a hypervisor.
*   A high level understanding of how an OS process interacts with its kernel: libc, syscalls.
*   A good understanding about the subsystems involved in the composition of a Linux container: namespaces, cgroups, CNI.

## What Is a Unikernel?

### Core Principles

In essence, a unikernel is a highly specialized type of kernel that is tailored for running one application, and that application specifically. By this property, a unikernel is capable of running in a single address space, where the usual distinction between kernel and user spaces does not exist. The application *is* the kernel, as much as the kernel is the application.

This design avoids paying the performance penalty of switching contexts on system calls between the user space and the kernel space, a behavior that is unavoidable in traditional operating systems. It allows a direct and quicker access to the hardware.

![There is only one address space in a unikernel, therefore no expensive context switches on system calls between user and kernel spaces.](https://labs.iximiuz.com/content/files/tutorials/unikernels-intro-93976514/__static__/addrspace.png)

*Unikernels operate in a single address space.*

There exists different types of unikernel projects. Some are tailored to run applications written in specific programming languages, others are more versatile. Some are monolithic, others are modular. Some require compiling and linking the application in a special way, others are able to run unmodified ELF executables.

Despite those differences, all strive to achieve specialization in a similar way: by selecting **only the components of the software stack which are relevant to the application**. For instance, there is no use for disk filesystem drivers in a piece of software which interacts solely with the network and does not write any data to disk. Likewise, because the unikernel is a single application, it does not require any user management or scheduling facilities. These become opportunities for reducing the software footprint by cutting on bloat, also reducing its attack surface by extension.

We often refer to the unikernel paradigm as "library operating systems".

![The unikernel is specialized by keeping only the components of the stack that are required for its particular application to function.](https://labs.iximiuz.com/content/files/tutorials/unikernels-intro-93976514/__static__/specialization.png)

*Specializing a unikernel by components selection.*

The artifact produced by building a unikernel is a kernel executable that comprises the application, along with only the parts of the OS kernel, libraries and possible runtime that were selected for that application. Because a unikernel is meant to be materialized as a virtual machine, the produced artifact is **specific to the target hypervisor** (KVM[4](https://labs.iximiuz.com/tutorials/unikernels-intro-93976514#user-content-fn-kvm), Xen[5](https://labs.iximiuz.com/tutorials/unikernels-intro-93976514#user-content-fn-xen), VMware, ...) and CPU architecture.

![The unikernel build process produces an artifact which can be used by a hypervisor to materialize a virtual machine.](https://labs.iximiuz.com/content/files/tutorials/unikernels-intro-93976514/__static__/artifact.png)

*Final unikernel artifact.*

List of existing unikernel projects

The [Unikernel Alliance](https://unikernelalliance.org/projects/) is the home of a few active unikernel (and unikernel-centric) projects to peruse:

-   [Unikraft](https://unikraft.org/)
-   [MirageOS](https://mirage.io/)
-   [OSv](https://osv.io/)
-   [Hermit](https://osv.io/)
-   [Toro](https://torokernel.io/)

There also exists a few noteworthy unikernel projects which are not part of the Unikernel Alliance:

-   [Nanos](https://nanos.org/)
-   [IncludeOS](https://www.includeos.org/)
-   [Rumprun](https://github.com/rumpkernel) _(retired)_

In summary, unikernels:

*   Operate in a drastically minimized software stack without separation between kernel and user spaces.
*   Have a smaller memory footprint and attack surface than a Linux process.
*   Do not share any kernel components with the host.
*   Benefit from the strong isolation of a virtual machine.

As a result, unikernels offer **increased security and performance** compared to a containerized Linux process.

### Trade-Offs

It would feel dishonest to praise unikernels for their many benefits without acknowledging some of their limitations.

Nowadays, the comparison of unikernels with Linux containers seems unavoidable, therefore the aspects enumerated below focus deliberately on use-cases that a container typically enables and which presents challenges when running the same application as a unikernel.

#### No Shell, No Users

We are starting with some fully embraced bait; the absence of shells and users is absolutely **desired** for reducing the attack surface of applications.

Yet, when comes the need to troubleshoot a misbehaving live application it is hard to beat the convenience of containers. Need to use a specific tool but the container's root filesystem is only one statically linked executable? No problem, attach your favorite debugging shell to the namespaces of the container, become root if you please, and off you go.

With a unikernel? You better be sure that the application has comprehensive observability facilities built-in.

#### Single Process

Unikernels are inherently **single-process OSes** due to their single address space design.

A range of applications use the POSIX [`fork`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html) system call to create child processes such as additional workers, data snapshotters, etc. Running such applications as unikernels present challenges and require trade-offs. Some notable examples:

*   The [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database server has process-based architecture rather than using threads.
*   The most widely used worker (MPM) of [Apache HTTPd](https://httpd.apache.org/) implements a hybrid multi-process / multi-threaded server.
*   The [Redis](https://redis.io/) in-memory cache persists data on disk using a child process.

Containers being regular OS processes, they do not suffer from such limitation.

Note that a recent research paper shows promising advancements in supporting `fork` in single-address-space operating systems: [μFork: Supporting POSIX fork Within a Single-Address-Space OS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09439) _(September 2025)_.

#### No Standardization

Unikernels are still considered a **niche technology** despite building on concepts developed in the late 1990s. As such, they lack the standardization that emerges once a technology achieves a certain degree of maturity. This means that there is currently no compatibility whatsoever between unikernel projects and their associated tooling.

Interestingly, compatibility with container-centric and *cloud-native* tooling is limited but not nonexistent, as you will discover later in this tutorial.

This lack of standardization is no different from the early days of containers, which weren't standardized either until several years into the existence of Docker containers.

#### Knowledge Requirements

Because unikernels are purpose-built and combine both the user and kernel code, they generally require a **deeper knowledge about the software stack** than is required for building conventional application artifacts. Porting an application as a unikernel *may* require specialist knowledge from the runtime through the kernel interfaces all the way down to the hardware.

As previously mentioned, there exists unikernel projects that can run unmodified ELF executables in a binary-compatible mode (POSIX compliant). Even though these do not enable the *full, uncompromised* performance and security benefits of purpose-built unikernels, they **preserve a number of those benefits** over a general-purpose, multi-user operating system kernel like Linux. They also bring the process of building a unikernel closer to the one of assembling a container image. Win-win.

#### Limited Inter-Process Communications

Finally, one limitation that stems from the virtual machine model and not the unikernel architecture in itself is the **lack of supporting facilities for inter-process communications**. Without a shared kernel to provide such facilities, applications running as unikernels must communicate over the network or via channels provided by their underlying hypervisor.

Containers allow multiple processes to be confined together and communicate over UNIX domain sockets, POSIX message queues, a loopback network interface, OS signals, etc.

## Building the Unikernel

Now that you are equipped with general knowledge about unikernels, let's begin with the hands-on part of the tutorial, shall we?

In this tutorial, you are going to build the [Nginx](https://nginx.org/) web server as a [Unikraft](https://unikraft.org/) unikernel, from sources.

Nginx is a classic example of server application that is both incredibly widespread[6](https://labs.iximiuz.com/tutorials/unikernels-intro-93976514#user-content-fn-nginx) and easy to interact with.

The Unikraft kernel was chosen for this tutorial because it ticks the following boxes:

1.  Comprehensive implementation of the library OS concept with a modular design that supports both porting from sources and binary compatibility.
2.  Supported by some of the OCI[7](https://labs.iximiuz.com/tutorials/unikernels-intro-93976514#user-content-fn-oci) tooling used later in this tutorial.

The playground box is pre-initialized with the following two directories inside your HOME:

*   `nginx/` is your workspace for building the Nginx application as a Unikraft unikernel.
*   `sources/` contains the source code of the Unikraft core, of Nginx itself (as a thin Unikraft library) and of additional libraries required by the Nginx application.

Start by changing your working directory to `nginx/`. You will remain in there throughout most of this tutorial:

This directory contains a few files which are solely responsible for **configuring and building** the unikernel:

```
ls -p1 --group-directories-first
```

```
oci/
rootfs/
workdir/
Config.uk
Makefile
Makefile.uk
qemu-x86_64.defconfig
```

Use the tabs below for a description of the purpose of each of these files:

qemu-x86\_64.defconfig

Config.uk

workdir

Makefile

A file in which [kernel options](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/SCSI-2.4-HOWTO/kconfig.html) with **non-default** values are specified.

Options which are specific to *our flavor* of the unikernel are enabled in this file and will be merged with the defaults of the Unikraft kernel:

*   The target platform/hypervisor: KVM.
*   Our preference for printing kernel messages at the info level (only errors are printed by default).
*   Some filesystem implementation (embedded initrd).

qemu-x86\_64.defconfig

```
CONFIG_PLAT_KVM=y
CONFIG_LIBUKDEBUG_PRINTK_INFO=y
CONFIG_LIBPOSIX_VFS_FSTAB=y
CONFIG_LIBPOSIX_VFS_FSTAB_BUILTIN=y
CONFIG_LIBPOSIX_VFS_FSTAB_BUILTIN_EINITRD=y
```

### Kernel Configuration

First, a kernel needs a [configuration](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/SCSI-2.4-HOWTO/kconfig.html), and a unikernel in no exception. You have already encountered the `qemu-x86_64.defconfig` file, you are now going to generate the **full kernel configuration** based on those few customized values:

```
UK_DEFCONFIG=$PWD/qemu-x86_64.defconfig make defconfig
```

```
  MAKE    kconfig
  ...
#
# configuration written to /home/laborant/nginx/.config
#
```

This command should have generated a file named `.config` inside the workspace:

It contains an aggregation of all the kernel options explicitly or implicitly selected inside the workspace, **merged with the defaults** from the Unikraft core.

Configuration TUI

Instead of invoking the `defconfig` goal, you could have selected kernel options via a terminal-based kernel configuration interface.

Since your `.config` file is already generated, opening this interface will display the options that were selected by the `defconfig` goal. Give it a try! If you have ever built the Linux kernel from sources this should look familiar, even spark a bit of nostalgia :)

(You might have to expand the side panel for your web-based terminal to have large enough dimensions.)

![ncurses-based kernel configuration TUI](https://labs.iximiuz.com/content/files/tutorials/unikernels-intro-93976514/__static__/menuconfig.png)

With the kernel configuration generated, you are now ready to proceed with the build. Let's go:

The build process goes through a few steps, including fetching the source code of the libraries and application (Nginx) which are not yet cached locally:

```
  ...
  WGET    libmusl: https://www.musl-libc.org/releases/musl-1.2.3.tar.gz
  ...
  WGET    libnginx: http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.15.6.tar.gz
```

Unfortunately, about 10 seconds in, an error comes and ruins the party already:

```
make[3]: *** No rule to make target '/home/laborant/nginx/initrd.cpio', needed by '/home/laborant/nginx/workdir/build/libposix_vfs_fstab/einitrd.o'.  Stop.
```

This is **part of the tutorial** and a good segue into some peculiarity about the unikernel you are building.

### Files Access

If you take a step back and think about what a typical application package contains—be it an OS package or a container image—you might be able to guess where we are heading. Let's take a look at the files included with the `nginx-common` package of the playground box's distribution:

```
/etc/default/nginx
/etc/init.d/nginx
/etc/logrotate.d/nginx
/etc/nginx/fastcgi.conf
/etc/nginx/fastcgi_params
/etc/nginx/koi-utf
/etc/nginx/koi-win
/etc/nginx/mime.types
/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
/etc/nginx/sites-available/default
/usr/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service
/usr/share/apport/package-hooks/source_nginx.py
/usr/share/doc/nginx-common/changelog.Debian.gz
/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
```

That's right, a bunch of static resources. While some are support files for the playground's Linux distribution (service definition, logrotate config, docs) others, such as the highlighted ones, are **required by the Nginx application** to function.

On any Linux system, exposing such files to an application is commonly accepted as storing the files on a mounted filesystem and giving read/write permissions on these files to the UNIX user that the application is going to run as. In a container image, those same files are either part of the root filesystem already, or bind mounted at run time to the root filesystem that the container pivots to.

But our unikernel does not have access to a filesystem exposed through a shared host kernel, so those files **must be provided to the application by different means**. One option could have been to enable selected filesystem drivers via kernel options and [share files from the host](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/9p_virtio) at run time through the target hypervisor, similarly to a bind mount on Linux.

![A volume can be mounted from the host over a virtual 9p VirtIO device and accessed by the guest via a compatible kernel driver.](https://labs.iximiuz.com/content/files/tutorials/unikernels-intro-93976514/__static__/vol9pfs.png)

*Sharing files from the host over the 9p protocol.*

However, the option we selected in this tutorial is to **embed the files** in an [initial ramdisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_ramdisk) (initrd) using the kernel option `LIBPOSIX_VFS_FSTAB_BUILTIN_EINITRD`. With this approach, the initial ramdisk is expanded into a root filesystem mounted as a read-write [RAM-based filesystem](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/ramfs-rootfs-initramfs.html) (ramfs) upon booting the unikernel. A perfect solution for static and non-persistent files.

![An initial ramdisk can be embedded into the unikernel at build time and mounted in memory at boot time.](https://labs.iximiuz.com/content/files/tutorials/unikernels-intro-93976514/__static__/voleinitrd.png)

*Embedding files into the unikernel as an initial ramdisk.*

We pinpointed earlier the lack of standardization across unikernel projects. The approaches proposed in this section are a demonstration of mechanisms and configurations which are highly Unikraft-specific and may or may not have an equivalent in other unikernels.

The files that need to be embedded are already part of your workspace and stored in the `rootfs/` directory:

```
rootfs/
└── nginx
    ├── conf
    │   ├── mime.types
    │   └── nginx.conf
    ├── html
    │   └── index.html
    └── logs
        └── error.log
```

You need to **convert the contents of this directory** into a cpio[8](https://labs.iximiuz.com/tutorials/unikernels-intro-93976514#user-content-fn-cpio) archive. (Remember the error message?) The Unikraft core includes a support script which achieves just that:

```
workdir/unikraft/support/scripts/mkcpio initrd.cpio rootfs
```

The result is an archive named `initrd.cpio` containing all the files staged for embedding into the unikernel artifact at build time.

```
?? .config
?? initrd.cpio
```

The cpio archive format

The format of a cpio archive isn't that different from that of a tarball. Files are merely concatenated with their contents separated by some headers and metadata.

You can print the contents of the generated `initrd.cpio` using the following command and verify that it matches that of the `rootfs/` directory:

### Kernel Build

You should now have all required resources sorted out:

*   `.config` – a kernel configuration.
*   `initrd.cpio` – an initial ramdisk for loading a root file system with a few static files into memory.

Let's try building the unikernel one more time:

After about 2 minutes, you should see the build succeed with a final linking and stripping of the build artifacts:

```
  ...
  OBJCOPY libmusl.o
  LD      nginx_qemu-x86_64.dbg
  SCSTRIP nginx_qemu-x86_64
  UKBI    nginx_qemu-x86_64.bootinfo
  MULTIBT nginx_qemu-x86_64.multiboot
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/laborant/sources/unikraft'
```

All files resulting from the build are written to the `build/` directory. The one without an extension in the list below is the **kernel**:

```
?? .config
?? initrd.cpio
?? workdir/build/nginx_qemu-x86_64
?? workdir/build/nginx_qemu-x86_64.bootinfo
?? workdir/build/nginx_qemu-x86_64.bootinfo.cmd
?? workdir/build/nginx_qemu-x86_64.cmd
?? workdir/build/nginx_qemu-x86_64.dbg
?? workdir/build/nginx_qemu-x86_64.dbg.cmd
?? workdir/build/nginx_qemu-x86_64.dbg.gdb.py
?? workdir/build/nginx_qemu-x86_64.multiboot.cmd
```

Unikraft kernel's naming convention

The base name of the generated kernel artifacts follows the naming convention:

```
$(CONFIG_UK_NAME)_$(KVM_VMM)-$(CONFIG_UK_ARCH)
```

You can verify that the file name `nginx_qemu-x86_64` indeed matches the kernel configuration used during the build:

```
grep -E 'CONFIG_(UK_NAME|UK_ARCH|KVM_VMM)' --color .config
```

```
CONFIG_UK_ARCH="x86_64"
CONFIG_KVM_VMM_QEMU=y
# CONFIG_KVM_VMM_FIRECRACKER is not set
CONFIG_UK_NAME="nginx"
```

The format of this kernel is an ELF executable, just like the Linux kernel that your playground box is currently running on:

Nginx unikernel

Linux kernel

```
file workdir/build/nginx_qemu-x86_64
```

```
workdir/build/nginx_qemu-x86_64: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, stripped
```

One thing should be particularly striking about this artifact: its small size. The Nginx application and all the OS components required for running it fit into... less than **2 MB**!

```
du -h workdir/build/nginx_qemu-x86_64
```

```
2.0M    workdir/build/nginx_qemu-x86_64
```

For comparison, on the playground box's distribution the `nginx` binary, the GNU libc and the Linux kernel taken together weigh almost 60 MB:

```
du -hL /boot/vmlinux /usr/sbin/nginx /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6
```

```
56M     /boot/vmlinux
1.3M    /usr/sbin/nginx
2.1M    /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6
```

## Running the Unikernel

The kernel you just built can be run as a *machine*. A unikernel could technically boot on a *physical machine* (e.g. your laptop) providing that it was built with drivers compatible with its hardware. However, unikernels are largely meant to run as **virtual machines** rather than physical ones, as mentioned in the introduction to this tutorial. This is mostly for two reasons:

*   One reason is that unikernels have such a minimal footprint that, in a majority of cases, it wouldn't make a lot of sense to dedicate the entire hardware of one machine to just one of them.
*   The second reason has to do with hardware compatibility. By targeting paravirtualized VirtIO[9](https://labs.iximiuz.com/tutorials/unikernels-intro-93976514#user-content-fn-virtio) devices for instance, a unikernel can indirectly support a lot of physical hardware while retaining its high performance guarantees.

### A Note on Hypervisor Support

Your `nginx_qemu-x86_64` kernel is suitable for the KVM hypervisor and its userspace component in the QEMU[10](https://labs.iximiuz.com/tutorials/unikernels-intro-93976514#user-content-fn-qemu) virtual machine manager (VMM). You will leverage both when running the unikernel on the playground box. Producing a unikernel for a different hypervisor (such as Xen) or a different VMM (such as Firecracker[11](https://labs.iximiuz.com/tutorials/unikernels-intro-93976514#user-content-fn-fc)) would have required **different build time parameters** (kernel options).

The KVM kernel module effectively turns the Linux host operating system into a [type-1 hypervisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor#Classification). To leverage this virtualization solution, the host's CPU needs to support certain CPU instructions through **virtualization extensions**.

Existing CPU extensions for virtualization

Virtualization extensions for x86-based CPUs are denoted as:

*   "SVM" on AMD CPUs, which stands for *Secure Virtual Machine*. Marketed as "AMD-V".
*   "VT-x" on Intel CPUs, which stands for *Virtual Machine Extensions*.

You can check whether those extensions are enabled on the playground box by looking for the corresponding CPU flags:

```
grep -E 'svm|vmx' --color /proc/cpuinfo
```

The other requirement is that the host's Linux kernel **includes the `kvm` module**, expectedly.

Both of those requirements can conveniently be checked using a single command: `kvm-ok`.

No KVM module is available inside iximiuz Labs playgrounds, whether `kvm_amd` nor `kvm_intel`, even though the CPU could support it:

```
INFO: /dev/kvm does not exist
HINT:   sudo modprobe kvm_amd
INFO: Your CPU supports KVM extensions
KVM acceleration can be used
```

```
modprobe: FATAL: Module kvm_amd not found in directory /lib/modules/5.10.246
```

This is luckily not an obstacle, as QEMU is capable of running virtual machines without KVM support. Machines with emulated hardware do not offer the same performance as the ones with hardware-assisted virtualization, but this is totally acceptable in the context of this tutorial.

Simply omit any KVM-related flag such as `-enable-kvm` in the following command and you should be good to go.

### Create and Run the Virtual Machine

Let's now run the kernel as a freshly created virtual machine using QEMU. Notice the **unikernel executable** you built in the previous section passed as argument, as well as **kernel command-line parameters** pointing at one of the files from your previously generated **cpio archive**:

```
sudo qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -nographic \
  -m 64M \
  -kernel workdir/build/nginx_qemu-x86_64 \
  -append '-c /nginx/conf/nginx.conf'
```

Interestingly, those kernel parameters do not look like typical [OS kernel command-line parameters](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html), and indeed they are not. Those parameters are [Nginx command-line parameters](https://nginx.org/en/docs/switches.html)! A unikernel has OS and application components built into a single kernel artifact, so this should hopefully make a lot of sense.

Should you need to pass parameters to the core kernel components, you would have to keep them separated from the application's parameters with `--`, as follows:

```
netdev.ip= vfs.fstab= random.seed= -- -c /nginx/conf/nginx.conf
```

We will use this mechanism in the next section of this tutorial.

As soon as the virtual machine is created, its console output will be printed to your terminal, just like when booting a Linux box. It includes the BIOS messages and the unikernel's boot messages:

```

There are three notable things to be observed in this output:

*   The `libposix_vfs_fstab` component initiated the extraction of the (embedded) initial ramdisk onto the ramfs filesystem at `/` (timestamp `0.109350`).
*   The `libukcpio` component proceeded with the actual extraction of each file and directory from the (embedded) initial ramdisk (from timestamp `0.110719`).
*   The `libukboot` component finally called the kernel's `main()` function, namely the Nginx application, with the parameters passed on the command line (timestamp `0.140582`).

All of this **under 150 milliseconds**, on emulated hardware.

For comparison, your current playground micro VM requires about 2 seconds just to reach the point where it can run its `init` process, and about half a second more for reaching the main user target, **with hardware acceleration enabled**.

Having to wait that long for starting a Nginx server would feel like an eternity.

sudo journalctl -b -o short-monotonic

Console logs of the playground box

Take a look at the console logs of your playground Linux box and compare them with what you are currently seeing in your terminal :)

![Console logs of the Linux playground box.](https://labs.iximiuz.com/content/files/tutorials/unikernels-intro-93976514/__static__/consolelogs.png)

So, what else can we do with this unikernel at that point? Not much, at least not just yet. Since you did not create the virtual machine with any **network device**, you cannot perform any meaningful interaction with the Nginx server, such as sending a HTTP request to it. This aspect was deliberately left out from this section. The good news is that **we are going to remediate to it in the next one**.

For now, terminate the QEMU process by sending the key combination Ctrl+A followed by X on your keyboard.

In case this key sequence does not work for you, open a second terminal and interrupt the QEMU process from there:

```
sudo killall qemu-system-x86_64
```

As the BIOS sends control characters which tend to **corrupt interactive terminals**, consider resetting your terminal's state now to avoid glitches when typing future commands:

## Docker Integration

By *Docker*, what we really mean here is *software conforming to the OCI image and runtime specifications*. But that didn't make for a catchy heading.

Arguably, we could have covered a bit of the network configuration required for obtaining a HTTP response from Nginx in the previous section, and this tutorial could have ended here. Except that would have meant passing on some very interesting ways of running unikernels **alongside Linux containers**.

Containers are currently the **dominant deployment unit** in the cloud-native landscape. A rich ecosystem of technologies, rallied behind the Kubernetes[12](https://labs.iximiuz.com/tutorials/unikernels-intro-93976514#user-content-fn-k8s) project, allows virtually anyone to run services at "Google-scale" nowadays. Much of this convenience stems from the assumption that everything is packaged and run **like a container**.

Could unikernels, instead of competing against this ecosystem, tap into its richness to ease their adoption?

It turns out that this idea isn't new. Several projects have shown that it is possible to run applications *as if they were a container*, but with the enhanced isolation of a virtual machine. Those are presented in the section *Secure Container Runtimes* of the post [Journey From Containerization To Orchestration And Beyond](https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/journey-from-containerization-to-orchestration-and-beyond/#secure-container-runtimes).

In this section, you will use two open source projects listed on the page of the [Unikernel Alliance](https://unikernelalliance.org/projects/):

*   [Bunny](https://github.com/nubificus/bunny) — to create an OCI image from your already built Nginx unikernel.
*   [urunc](https://github.com/urunc-dev/urunc) — to run the Nginx unikernel off its OCI image, this time with network support.

... all of this using **nothing but the `docker` CLI**.

Let's get started.

### OCI Image

Bunny makes packaging unikernels as easy as it is to package containers. The resulting images are **standard OCI images** that can be pushed to and pulled from any container registry.

First off, change your working directory to `oci/`, assuming that you are currently still in the `nginx/` workspace:

This directory contains a single file named `bunnyfile` with a YAML syntax.

bunnyfile

```
#syntax=harbor.nbfc.io/nubificus/bunny:latest
version: v0.1

platforms:
  framework: unikraft
  version: 0.20.0
  monitor: qemu
  architecture: x86

kernel:
  from: local
  path: nginx_qemu-x86_64

cmd: ['-c', '/nginx/conf/nginx.conf']
```

You would be right to assume that a unikernel shall be packaged using instructions from a `Dockerfile`, like any other container image. However, because Bunny was designed to be used as a frontend for BuildKit[13](https://labs.iximiuz.com/tutorials/unikernels-intro-93976514#user-content-fn-buildkit), it is able to parse its **own build definition** which is tailored for packaging the special software artifact which are unikernels.

In a `bunnyfile`, the generic and imperative instructions of a `Dockerfile` (`ENV`, `COPY`, `RUN`, etc.) are traded for declarative and structured attributes which describe the nature of the unikernel and how it should be run:

*   The `framework` it was built with (what type of unikernel).
*   The virtual machine `monitor` that can run it (what hypervisor).
*   The `cmd` (command-line parameters) that should be supplied to the kernel at boot time.
*   The `path` at which the kernel image resides on the local filesystem.

The `Dockerfile` syntax is also supported by Bunny as an alternative to the `bunnyfile` syntax.

According to that last `path` instruction, Bunny expects the unikernel executable inside the current directory with the name `nginx_qemu-x86_64`, so you will need to copy it there:

```
cp ../workdir/build/nginx_qemu-x86_64 .
```

Run a Docker image build inside the current directory, using `bunnyfile` in place of the default `Dockerfile`, and see what happens:

```
docker image build \
  -f bunnyfile \
  -t lab/nginx-unikernel:latest \
  .
```

```

```

Even though `bunny` does not come pre-installed inside the playground box, the build completed without hurdle. Is this surprising? Upon closer inspection, it shouldn't be.

Because the first line in the `bunnyfile` is a `syntax` directive with a special meaning, BuildKit was able to understand that it had to **load the `bunny` frontend dynamically** from a container image and invoke it to generate its build graph:

```
#syntax=harbor.nbfc.io/nubificus/bunny:latest
```

Neat!

The OCI images produced by Bunny have the peculiarity of being automatically labeled with some exotic key-values. You can enumerate these by inspecting the `lab/nginx-unikernel:latest` image you created:

```
docker image inspect \
  --format='{{range $k,$v := .Config.Labels}}{{printf "%s=%s\n" $k $v}}{{end}}' \
  lab/nginx-unikernel:latest
```

```
com.urunc.unikernel.binary=/.boot/kernel
com.urunc.unikernel.cmdline=-c /nginx/conf/nginx.conf
com.urunc.unikernel.hypervisor=qemu
com.urunc.unikernel.initrd=
com.urunc.unikernel.mountRootfs=false
com.urunc.unikernel.unikernelType=unikraft
com.urunc.unikernel.unikernelVersion=0.20.0
```

Without further ado, let's figure out what makes those labels useful.

### OCI Runtime

In order to create and run a container, the `containerd` container manager invokes a *container runtime* that prepares the containerized process to run within the desired namespaces and cgroups hierarchy. In the realm of Linux containers, the container runtime of reference is [`runc`](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc).

`runc` makes numerous assumptions about the way a container has to run:

*   a Linux process
*   on top of a shared kernel
*   with standard I/O streams (stdin/stdout/stderr)
*   isolated from other processes by namespaces
*   with its resources constrained by the facilities of that shared kernel (cgroups)

A unikernel is different. As a virtual machine running under the management of a virtual machine manager:

*   Its resource constraints are enforced by virtualized hardware, not just cgroups.
*   The host's namespaces do not propagate inside the guest, making namespaces such as `PID`, `Mount`, `User` and `Cgroup` largely irrelevant.
*   Bind mounts must be passed from the host through the hypervisor, in a form that is supported by the guest kernel.
*   I/O streams of the guest application are not forwarded outside of the virtual machine.

For those reasons, spinning up a unikernel–or in fact any kind of virtual machine–from a container image requires a container runtime that is **aware of those distinctions** and is capable of **operating around them**.

That runtime is `urunc`.

In `containerd`, there is a naming convention that allows selecting a specific runtime for running a container without having to configure `containerd` to know about that runtime. By requesting a runtime named `io.containerd.$(RUNTIME).v2` on the command line, `containerd` attempts to create the container through the shim executable `containerd-shim-$(RUNTIME)-v2`, if available in the PATH.

It turns out that the `urunc` shim executable installed on the playground box follows that naming convention:

```
ls -F1 /usr/local/bin/*urunc*
```

```
/usr/local/bin/containerd-shim-urunc-v2*
/usr/local/bin/urunc*
```

So all you need to do in order to pick `urunc` for running your Nginx unikernel image is specify that runtime name as an argument to `docker container run`. We also set its name explicitly to `unikernel` to facilitate future `docker` commands:

```
docker container run \
  -d --rm \
  --name unikernel \
  --runtime io.containerd.urunc.v2 \
  lab/nginx-unikernel:latest
```

```
e2348010d439f4f8197d1d706b2f99fbeebab76595e8320478057f7c48fc2da0
```

Default runtime

When the `--runtime` flag is not specified in `docker container run` commands, `containerd` chooses the runtime based on its own default. In a vanilla `containerd` distribution, this default is `runc`:

```
containerd config default
```

config.toml

```
  [plugins.'io.containerd.cri.v1.runtime']
    #...

    [plugins.'io.containerd.cri.v1.runtime'.containerd]
      default_runtime_name = 'runc'
      #...

      [plugins.'io.containerd.cri.v1.runtime'.containerd.runtimes]
        [plugins.'io.containerd.cri.v1.runtime'.containerd.runtimes.runc]
          runtime_type = 'io.containerd.runc.v2'
```

Verify that the unikernel is running (as a container):

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                        COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
e2348010d439   lab/nginx-unikernel:latest   "-c /nginx/conf/ngin…"   10 seconds ago   Up 10 seconds             unikernel
```

Then print its logs (console output):

```
docker container logs unikernel
```

```

The output is more or less identical to the one shown when you ran the unikernel via QEMU earlier.

As the BIOS sends control characters which tend to **corrupt interactive terminals**, consider resetting your terminal's state now to avoid glitches when typing future commands:

It doesn't end here. Check the IP address assigned to the container:

```
docker container inspect \
  --format='{{.NetworkSettings.Networks.bridge.IPAddress}}' \
  unikernel
```

Then send a HTTP request to that IP address using `curl`:

```
curl -D- http://172.17.0.2
```

```

This time around, **networking is fully functional**, and it appears to be working just like with a container!

That is great progress compared to what you ended up with at the end of the previous section. Not only interacting with the application running inside the guest is now a reality, but reaching that state was **remarkably easy**; you did not need to use anything but `docker` commands, or even make adjustments to your unikernel.

## Understanding the Unikernel Container

We are now going to dissect what just happened in order to understand how making the unikernel feel like we are interacting with a Linux container is even possible.

As explained earlier in this tutorial, iximiuz Labs playgrounds do not support KVM. During its initialization, your playground box built and installed a *patched* version of `urunc` which omits certain problematic QEMU CLI flags such as `-enable-kvm`.

### Process Tree

If you look at the processes currently running in your playground box, you should see a process with a familiar command line at the bottom of the list:

```
  PPID     PID    PGID ... COMMAND
     1   23927   23927 ... /usr/local/bin/containerd-shim-urunc-v2 -namespace moby -id e2348010d439f4f8197d1d706b2f99fbeebab76595e8320478057f7c48fc2da0 -address /run/containerd/containerd.sock
 23927   23951   23951 ...  \_ /usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 -m 268M -L /usr/share/qemu -nographic -vga none -smp 1 --sandbox on,obsolete=deny,elevateprivileges=deny,spawn=deny,resourcecontrol=deny -kernel /.boot/kernel -net nic,model=virtio,macaddr=6e:e5:40:9d:22:87 -net tap,script=no,downscript=no,ifname=tap0_urunc -append Unikraft  env.vars=[ PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin HOSTNAME=e2348010d439 ] netdev.ip=172.17.0.2/24:172.17.0.1:8.8.8.8    -- -c /nginx/conf/nginx.conf
```

That's right, a QEMU process, parented to the `urunc` container shim, with arguments that look very similar to the ones you passed on the command line to create the virtual machine manually in the previous section of this tutorial.

Remember those somewhat exotic labels set on the container image? You just found the usage of two of them:

```
com.urunc.unikernel.hypervisor=qemu
com.urunc.unikernel.cmdline=-c /nginx/conf/nginx.conf
```

This parenting of `qemu-system-x86_64` to the container shim is the reason why `docker container logs` printed the standard output (stdout) of the QEMU process, namely the virtual machine's console output.

Intermediate process tree

If you manage to list the processes fast enough while the container is still being created, you will notice that the process with the container's PID was originally **a `urunc` process** (not to be mistaken for a *urunc shim* process):

Upon starting the container, `urunc` eventually "became" the container process (`qemu-system-x86_64`) by means of a POSIX [`exec`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html) system call.

The author of this tutorial wrote extensively about what happens between the creation of the *container shim* and that of the *container process* in a post titled [OCI runtime: container creation flow](https://acotten.com/2023/08/17/oci-runtime-create-flow).

This parent-child relationship between the two processes also means that the "unikernel container" *is* a virtual machine monitored by QEMU. In other words, where a regular Nginx container would have `nginx` running as the container process, `urunc` created a `qemu-system-x86_64` process to run the unikernel.

To verify this, compare the process ID (PID) of the container seen by Docker to the process ID seen by Linux for the process name `qemu-system-x86_64`. Both commands will print the same value:

```
docker container inspect unikernel --format='{{.State.Pid}}'
pidof qemu-system-x86_64
```

![QEMU is parented to a container shim process which forwards its I/O streams like a regular container.](https://labs.iximiuz.com/content/files/tutorials/unikernels-intro-93976514/__static__/ctprocesses.png)

*Unikernel VM parented to a container shim.*

To verify that `urunc` created the `qemu-system-x86_64` process inside a distinct PID namespace like in a regular container, enter the `pid` namespace of the `unikernel` container and list its processes.

QEMU will be displayed with the PID `1` this time, not `23951`:

```
docker run \
  --pid=container:unikernel \
  busybox \
  ps
```

```

    9 root      0:00 ps
```

### Network Plumbing

The PID namespace may be largely irrelevant for the unikernel, but another namespace is crucial: **the *Network* namespace**.

Before diving into namespaces, let's take another look at the command-line parameters of the QEMU process. Compared to our first, manual invocation of QEMU, the one spawned by `urunc` has a few additional flags related to network devices:

```
-net nic,model=virtio,macaddr=ce:e9:db:b0:cd:d7
-net tap,script=no,downscript=no,ifname=tap0_urunc
```

`urunc` also prepended the kernel command-line declared in the container image with few extra parameters, especially:

```
netdev.ip=172.17.0.2/24:172.17.0.1:8.8.8.8
```

The fact that `172.17.0.2` is the same IP address as the one you sent a HTTP request to earlier is noteworthy.

You might remember the following statement from right after you printed the logs of the container:

> The output is more or less identical to the one shown when you ran the unikernel via QEMU earlier.

Well, a few network-related console messages actually are a novelty compared to the first, manual run of the Nginx unikernel:

```
docker container logs unikernel | grep -E 'lwip|net|en1' --color
```

```

```

Those messages indicate that the unikernel recognized the network device provided by QEMU (a VirtIO device) and was able to configure a corresponding **network interface**.

For reference, the first, manual run only showed:

```
[    0.107715] Warn: [liblwip] <init.c @  460> No network interface attached!
```

How did `urunc` know what command-line parameters to pass to the unikernel to configure its network stack?

Remember those somewhat exotic labels set on the container image (again)? One of them was:

```
com.urunc.unikernel.unikernelType=unikraft
```

By knowing the type of unikernel it is running, `urunc` is capable of selecting the appropriate command-line parameters. Mystery solved!

Now, the network device and kernel command-line parameters alone **do not suffice** to making the guest's Nginx web server reachable from the host. Why? Because at that point the IP address `172.17.0.2` is **not yet assigned to any network interface on the host**.

Before a container is started, `containerd` calls a CNI[14](https://labs.iximiuz.com/tutorials/unikernels-intro-93976514#user-content-fn-cni) plugin to set up the container's network. It is during that process that the network interface(s) of the container are created and configured. Typically, the outcome is a **pair of [veth](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/veth.4.html) devices**: one inside the root Network namespace and one inside the container's. The root end gets attached to a [bridge](https://man.netbsd.org/bridge.4) device so that network packets can be routed to the container over that bridge (`docker0` on the playground box).

CNI-less setup

In certain environments, such as your playground box, `containerd` isn't configured to set up the network by calling a CNI plugin. In that case, the Docker daemon handles the setup of the container's network itself.

Take a look at the network links inside both of these namespaces:

Root links

Container links

The `veth0744538` interface with the ID `8` is the root end of the veth pair.

Its peer is the interface with the ID `2` (denoted by the suffix `@if2`) inside the container's Network namespace.

In a standard setup, the container's Network namespace would only have the `lo` (loopback) and `eth0` (veth) interfaces. On the *Container* tab above though, you can see an additional `tap0_urunc` interface. What is that?

`tap0_urunc` is a [tap](https://man.netbsd.org/tap.4) network device created by `urunc` and provided to QEMU with the command-line flag `-net tap,ifname=tap0_urunc`. The usage of such devices is the standard way in QEMU to connect the network interface of the guest (unikernel) to a real network, such as the one of the Linux host.

This is an implementation decision of `urunc`, and a clever design when you think about it.

CNI can configure network interfaces in a lot of [different manners](https://www.cni.dev/plugins/current/) inside a container's network. A containerized Linux process can always assume that the network is usable as-is, thanks to the plumbing operated by CNI.

For an application running as a guest inside a virtual machine, **this assumption falls apart** and deploying a working network stack may require non-trivial configuration of both the host and guest.

A container runtime such as `urunc` cannot possibly have differentiated logic for each CNI plugin under the sun. What it can do, however, is rely on the `tap0_urunc` interface to look the same in every unikernel container, then configure the network to redirect all network packets between `tap0_urunc` and the default interface inside the container's Network namespace (`eth0`).

`urunc` implements this through [traffic control](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc.8.html), using *egress redirects*. You can peek inside the container's Network namespace and inspect those filters:

Redirect to eth0

Redirect to tap0

Ingress filter that redirects `tap0_urunc`\->`eth0`:

```
sudo nsenter -t "$(pidof qemu-system-x86_64)" --net \
  tc filter show dev tap0_urunc ingress
```

```
filter parent ffff: protocol all pref 49152 u32 chain 0
filter parent ffff: protocol all pref 49152 u32 chain 0 fh 800: ht divisor 1
filter parent ffff: protocol all pref 49152 u32 chain 0 fh 800::800 order 2048 key ht 800 bkt 0 terminal flowid not_in_hw
  match 00000000/00000000 at 0
        action order 1: mirred (Egress Redirect to device eth0) stolen
        index 1 ref 1 bind 1
```

![The unikernel guest is connected via a TAP device to the host network. Traffic control allows packets to be redirected between the tap0_urunc interface and the container's default interface eth0.](https://labs.iximiuz.com/content/files/tutorials/unikernels-intro-93976514/__static__/ctnetw.png)

*Unikernel guest connected to the host network via a TAP device.*

In summary, the `urunc` container runtime managed to network the unikernel behind a regular container IP address by combining the following components and mechanisms:

*   A **container network interface** set up by CNI outside of the unikernel.
*   A **tap network interface** connecting the guest's network interface to the host's network.
*   Some **traffic control filters that redirect network packets** between that tap interface and the container's default network interface.

That approach allows to connect practically any virtual machine to the host inside a Network namespace, making it possible to manage container and unikernel workloads using the same container infrastructure.

### Resource Constraints

This tutorial is now being concluded by touching on the container configurations that can affect the settings of the unikernel virtual machine.

Let's look one more time at the command-line parameters of the QEMU process:

```
cat /proc/"$(pidof qemu-system-x86_64)"/cmdline | xargs --null
```

```
/usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 -m 268M -L /usr/share/qemu -nographic ...
```

The flag `-m 268M` allocates a RAM size of 268 MiB to the virtual machine's guest, even though you did not specify any resource constraint with the `docker container run` command. Why is that?

Containerized processes run inside a cgroups hierarchy that constrains their resource usage for CPU, memory, disk I/O, etc. Applying this model to a virtual machine makes little sense because virtual machines have a distinct isolation model underpinned by virtualized hardware.

`urunc` did in fact not place the QEMU process into a particular cgroups hierarchy, so it inherited the hierarchy of the `containerd` service:

```
systemctl status "$(pidof qemu-system-x86_64)"
```

```

```

Instead, `urunc` attempted to translate the container configuration into suitable virtual machine parameters. Because no memory configuration was requested, a reasonably large RAM size of 268 MiB was decided upon (QEMU's default is 128 MiB).

```
docker container inspect \
  --format='{{.HostConfig.Memory}}' \
  unikernel
```

When an application is deployed as a regular Linux container, the container runtime can generally make assumptions about cgroups being the preferred method for constraining the resource usage of that application, in accordance with the container's configuration. In a context where the application is instead deployed as a virtual machine, the container runtime must make its own decisions in order to **match the requested constraints as closely as possible**.

Let's see what `urunc` does when we explicitly set resource constraints while creating the unikernel container.

Terminate the previous container to avoid future confusions:

```
docker container stop unikernel
```

Create another unikernel container, this time with an explicit memory constraint of 64 MiB:

```
docker container run \
  -d --rm \
  --name unikernel \
  --runtime io.containerd.urunc.v2 \
  --memory 64_000_000 \
  lab/nginx-unikernel:latest
```

Verify that the new container has the expected configuration:

```
docker container inspect \
  --format='{{.HostConfig.Memory}}' \
  unikernel
```

Last but not least, ensure that the new QEMU virtual machine **has 64 MiB of RAM instead of 268 MiB**:

```
cat /proc/"$(pidof qemu-system-x86_64)"/cmdline | xargs --null
```

```
/usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 -m 64M -L /usr/share/qemu -nographic ...
```

This short experiment should hopefully be a good demonstration of how parity can be achieved between various methods of constraining the resource usage of containers that differ in nature, such as unikernel VMs.

## Summary

In this tutorial, you've learnt about **what a unikernel is**: its architecture, what it enables, but also its limitations.

Through some guided hands-on activity, you've **built a web server application as a unikernel**, an exercise which hopefully ignited your curiosity to explore other unikernel frameworks and experiment with them.

You've seen how some existing open source projects make it possible to **integrate unikernels with a container-centric infrastructure**, without having to discard the tools you are already familiar with.
